Exercise 4:
-----------
The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:

CREATE DATABASE database_name;

The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all 
commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.

>> CREATE DATABASE first_database;
