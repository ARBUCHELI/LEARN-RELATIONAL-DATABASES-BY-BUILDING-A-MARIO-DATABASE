Exercise 10:
------------
Looks like there's no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:

CREATE TABLE table_name();
Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to. Create a table 
named first_table in second_database.

>> CREATE TABLE first_table();
